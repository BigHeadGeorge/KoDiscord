# KoDiscord
This small application sits in your system tray, and watches Kodi's currently played media.
If it happens to notice a `movie` or `episode` to be playing it sets your Discord status to `movie` or `episode`.

You can even have this running in the background, if no media is detected it removes the Discord Rich Presence, and once media detected again, reconnects the Discord Rich Presence.

# Examples:  
### Movie is playing

### Movie is paused
